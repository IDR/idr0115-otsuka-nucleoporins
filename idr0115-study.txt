Protocol Description	Cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/l D-glucose (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 _g/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2.	On the day of live-cell imaging, DMEM was replaced by imaging medium: CO2-independent medium without phenol red (Invitrogen) containing 20% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 100 _g/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The imaging medium was supplemented with 50 nM silicon-rhodamine (SiR) Hoechst.	Cells were imaged in 3D using a confocal microscope (LSM780; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a 40_ 1.2 NA C-Apochromat water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss) at 37 °C in a microscope-body-enclosing incubator.
